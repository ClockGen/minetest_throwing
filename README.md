 ##  Throwing mod reloaded
 
 #### This is a mirror of throwing mod for minetest by Echoes91, which was further improved by MinetestForFun team.
 * Being an excellent ranged weapons mod for minetest already, it was further improved by MinetestForFun team, enabling PvP-damage, mob anger towards the attacker, resolved many bugs and optimized the code. It's fully suited and ready for survival and pvp gameplay. Since MinetestForFun didn't have separate repo for this mod (it only exists as a part of their server modpack), I decided to fork it (so it would be easily accesible for git clone) and make some changes to have less dependencies.
 * Changes: I restored original, low-res textures by Echoes91, changed parameters of bows to shoot further and removed some items to not depend on some mods (minotaur horn bow and mithril arrows).
