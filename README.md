## Throwing reloaded
## This is another fork of throwing mod for minetest by Echoes91, which was further improved by MinetestForFun team.
## Requirements
* Minetest 0.4.16+
#### Optionally requires:
* Vines from plantlife pack (rope arrow)
* Lightning (lightning arrow)
* Moreores (mithril arrow)
## New Stuff
* Rewrote code related to damage, which causes mobs to respond to your attacks
* Returned velocity-based damage
* Increased base velocity of all bows and crossbows 
* Added one new crossbow (repeating crossbow) and replaced royal bow with more realistic equivalent
* Added more colors to fireworks
* Added new lightning arrow(activates if you have lightning mod installed), which causes a lightning strike at the point of impact
* Added new rope arrow, which places a rope block from vines mod upon a hit (activates if you have vine mod from plantlife modpack enabled)
* Rewrote tnt arrow, that now has cosmetic effect of an explosion and AoE damage, but no actual node destruction
* Added particle effects and sounds to all arrows, usual arrows produce particles and sound on impact, teleport arrows make particles like teleporters from telemosaic mod, etc
* New textures for teleport, lightning, fireworks, and mithril arrows
* Settings moved to minetest.conf, configurable either in minetest advanced options (in mods section) or in minetest.conf
* Various code optimizations, fixes and improvements
